fetch-course-emails
-------------------

(This is no longer used by DataHub. We obtain enrollment information through our CanvasOAuthenticator.)

This container fetches the campus email addresses of students and instructors
in specified UCB courses. It runs as a sidecar container alongside hubs
provisioned by berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub.

Configuration
=============

Container
=========

This container is run as a sidecar by specifying it under hub.extraContainers.
Provide API credentials as environment variables in encrypted configuration (i.e. secrets):
```
jupyterhub:
  hub:
    extraContainers:
      - name: fetch-course-emails
        image: berkeleydsep/fetch-course-emails:v3
        volumeMounts:
          # for writing out email lists ; consider new volume
          - name: hub-db-dir
            mountPath: /srv/jupyterhub
          # for reading in profiles
          - name: config
            mountPath: /etc/jupyterhub/config
        env:
        - name: UCB_HR_ID
          value: "..."
        - name: UCB_HR_KEY
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_CLASSES_ID
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_CLASSES_KEY
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_ENROLLMENTS_ID
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_ENROLLMENTS_KEY
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_TERMS_ID
          value: "..."
        - name: SIS_TERMS_KEY
          value: "..."
```

Profiles
========
Courses are specified as keys of the form {year}-{term}-{class_section_id} in
the helm config. For example:

```
# current z2jh
jupyterhub:
  hub:
    extraConfigMap:
      profiles:
        2019-spring-25622:
          mem_limit: 4096M
          mem_guarantee: 2048M

# newer z2jh
custom:
  profiles:
    2019-spring-25622:
      mem_limit: 4096M
      mem_guarantee: 2048M
```

See https://classes.berkeley.edu for class section IDs.

Output
======
The container saves email addresses into files:
```
/srv/jupyterhub/profiles.d/{year}-{term}-{class_section_id}-students.txt
/srv/jupyterhub/profiles.d/{year}-{term}-{class_section_id}-instructors.txt
```
which are read by the custom spawner.
